## What is this project?
  
This shiny app (in development) allows you to explore the dynamics of some key population models from theoretical ecology, applied to serial dilution experiments as in [*Landis et al. 2021*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61644). In short, we are thinking about a population of a single species of microbe (bacteria, yeast, etc.) that grows according to our population model, and every 48 hours is diluted to 2.5 as it is transfered to new media. For context, we present the actual data from experiments of this sort from *Landis et al. 2021*. Dashed lines show projected population dynamics, circles show experimental data, triangles show the mean of the experimental data.
